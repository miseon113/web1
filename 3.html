  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="more information about JavaScript">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language.<br>
     It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.</p>

     <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.<br>
     JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.<br>
     The vast majority of websites use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>

     <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.<br>
     It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O,
      such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.</p>

      <p>Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software,
        <br> including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.</p>

      <p>Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, <br>
        including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design;<br>
         JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme. </p>
