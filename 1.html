  <p> Today, We are going to make a web page !<br>
    I can't do that well yet.<br>
    But I will grow up in this field. :) <br>
    And  at end of this vacation,
    I can make <strong>the only one <u>web page</u> and application</strong> ! </p>

    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" target="_blank" title="more information">star</a> is type of astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity.<br>
      The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth.
      <br> Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names.
      <br> Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. <br>
      However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth.
      <br>Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. </p>
